# my-python-projects

A collection of beginner-friendly **Python projects** that showcase my growth in:

- Programming fundamentals
- Problem solving
- Command-line apps
- Working with simple APIs

Each project is small on purpose — focused on learning one concept at a time.

## 🚀 How to Run

Most projects follow this pattern:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/GrandMaTech76/my-python-projects.git
cd my-python-projects

# Enter a specific project folder when you create them, e.g.:
cd budget-tracker

# Run the script
python main.py    # or 'python3 main.py'
